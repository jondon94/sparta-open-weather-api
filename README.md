## Weather API

**Introduction**

>This file contains the basic structure of calling an API from the internet using an authorised API key. It has been creted to learn how to run SOM tests against an API using rspec.


**Instructions**

- Clone the Repo on to your machine.
- Type 'rspec' in to the terminal.
- The tests conducted will be displayed in the terminal. A green test indicates it passed, red means it failed and there is a short description of the failure.
- To create more tests, follow the structure of existing tests to ensure that the relevant information is being supplied by the api.

**Comments**

>Initially this took a while to get the hang of but after carefully going over the specific file structure it is clear that it is designed for readability and to streamline creation of tests.
